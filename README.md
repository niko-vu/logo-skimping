# Logo Skimping

## Description

An application that asks for user input and creates a logo based on their response.

This project was really fun for me to do. This one was a lot like my other project that generated a markdown file based on user input so working on it helped to reinforce what I've been learning about inquirer and node.js. I finished this project and had the motivation to finish it in the first place because I wanted to further practice my knowledge.
